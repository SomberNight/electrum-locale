msgid "Your node will negotiate the transaction fee with the remote node. This method of closing the channel usually results in the lowest fees."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you request a force-close, your node will pretend that it has lost its data and ask the remote node to broadcast their latest state. Doing so from time to time helps make sure that nodes are honest, because your node can punish them if they broadcast a revoked state."

msgid "The channel you created is not recoverable from seed.\n"
"To prevent fund losses, please save this backup on another device.\n"
"It may be imported in another Electrum wallet with the same seed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Electrum uses static channel backups. If you lose your wallet file, you will need to request your channel to be force-closed by the remote peer in order to recover your funds. This assumes that the remote peer is reachable, and has not lost its own data."

msgstr ""

msgid "Installing this plugin will grant third-party software access to your wallet. You must trust the plugin not to be malicious."

msgstr ""

msgid "In the Electrum mobile app, use the 'Send' button to scan this QR code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Please note that channel backups cannot be used to restore your channels."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you lose your wallet file, the only thing you can do with a backup is to request your channel to be closed, so that your funds will be sent on-chain."
msgstr ""

msgid "This summary covers only on-chain transactions (no lightning!). Capital gains are computed by attaching an acquisition price to each UTXO in the wallet, and uses the order of blockchain events (not FIFO)."

msgid "This channel is with a non-trampoline node; it cannot be used if trampoline is enabled.\n"

msgid "Your funding transaction has been broadcast."
msgstr ""

msgid "Please remain online until the funding transaction is confirmed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The swap will be finalized once your transaction is confirmed."
msgstr ""

msgid "After the funding transaction is mined, the server will reveal the preimage needed to fulfill the pending received lightning HTLCs. The HTLCs expire in {} blocks. You will need to be online after the funding transaction is confirmed but before the HTLCs expire, to claim your money. If you go offline for several days while the swap is pending, you risk losing the swap amount!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The funding transaction has been detected."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your claiming transaction will be broadcast when the funding transaction is confirmed."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you go offline before broadcasting the claiming transaction and let the swap time out, you will not get back the already pre-paid mining fees."
msgstr ""

msgid "You will need to come back online after the commitment transaction is confirmed, in order to broadcast second-stage htlc transactions."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you remain offline for more than {} blocks, your channel counterparty will be able to sweep those funds."
msgstr ""

msgid "You will need to come back online after the funding transaction is confirmed, in order to settle the swap."

msgid "If you remain offline for more than {} blocks, your channel will be force closed and you might lose the funds you sent in the swap."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you remain offline for more than {} blocks, the swap will be cancelled and you will lose the prepaid mining fees."
msgstr ""

msgid "You do not have enough on-chain funds to protect your Lightning channels."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Auto-connect"
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual server selection"
msgstr ""

msgid "Connect only to a single server"
msgstr ""

msgid "Electrum connects to a unique server in order to receive your transaction history. This server will learn your wallet addresses."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to your history server, Electrum will try to maintain connections with ~10 extra servers, in order to download block headers and find out the longest blockchain. These servers are only used for block header notifications and fee estimates; they do not learn your wallet addresses. Getting block headers from multiple sources is useful to detect lagging servers and forks. Fork detection is security-critical for determining number of confirmations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Electrum will always use a history server that is on the longest blockchain. If your current server is unresponsive or lagging, Electrum will switch to another server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Electrum will stay with the server you selected. It will warn you if your server is lagging."
msgstr ""

msgid "Electrum will stay with the server you selected, and it will not connect to additional nodes. This will disable fork detection. This mode is only intended for connecting to your own fully trusted server. Using this option on a public server is a security risk and is discouraged."
msgstr ""

msgid "Submarine Payments use a reverse submarine swap to do on-chain transactions directly from your lightning balance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Submarine Payments happen in two stages. In the first stage, your wallet sends a lightning payment to the submarine swap provider. The swap provider will lock funds to a funding output in an on-chain transaction (the funding transaction)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once the funding transaction has one confirmation, your wallet will broadcast a claim transaction as the second stage of the payment. This claim transaction spends the funding output to the payee's address."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The funding transaction is not visible to the payee. They will only see a pending transaction in the mempool after your wallet broadcasts the claim transaction. Since confirmation of the funding transaction can take over 30 minutes, avoid using Submarine Payments when the payee expects to see the transaction within a limited time frame (e.g., an online shop checkout). Use a regular on-chain payment instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "This transaction requires a higher fee, or it will not be propagated by your current server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try to raise your transaction fee, or use a server with a lower relay fee."
